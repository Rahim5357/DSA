/* BIG O NOTATION*/
/*
1. The Worst case complexity of an algorithm is represented using the Big-O notaion
2. Big-O notaion described the complexity of an algorithm using terms
It has two important characteristics
   1. It is expressed in terms of the input
   2. It focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details
*/


/* Big O Time Complexity*/

/*
1. O(n) - Linear Time Complexity
2. O(1) - Constant Time Complexity
3. O(n^2) -Quantity Time Complexity
4. O(n^3) - Cubic Time Complexity
5, O(logn) - Logarthmic Time Complexity
