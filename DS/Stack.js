// ! STACK
// The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of Last-In-First-Out(LIFO)

//The last element inserted into the stack is first element to be removed

//A stack of plates.The last plate placed on top of the stack is also the first plate removed from the stack.

//Stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather being a mathematical model

//The stack data structure supports two main operations

// -->Push, which adds an element to the collection
// -->Pop, Which removes the most recently added element from the collection

// ! Stack Implementation

// push(element) - add an element to the top of the stack
// pop() - remove the most element from the stack
// peek() - get the value of the top element without removing it 
// isEmpty() - check if the stack is empty
// size() - check if the stack is empty
// print() - visualize the elements in the stack
